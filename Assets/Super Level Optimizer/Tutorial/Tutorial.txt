Hi. Thank You that bought my asset.

Super Level Optimizer is very simple in development, now I will show it.

To create Super Level Optimizer pass into "Tools/NGSTools/SuperLevelOptimizer/Create Optimizer".

Now we will consistently sort all Super Level Optimizer components:
1) "Super Optimization". Inclusion of this flag means that at some atlases will be generated not absolutely correctly, but the quantity (not always) of Draw Calls in comparison with if you didn't include this flag will decrease.
2) "SearchState". At "Automatical", Super Level Optimizer will combine all "batching static" objects. At "User" You will be able to choose objects for optimization.
3) "Combine State". At "Combine To Scene" objects will remain in a scene. At "Combine To Prefab" objects will be will remain in the folder chosen by You.
4) "Create Atlases". We generate atlases.
5) "Combine Meshes". We unite mesha.
6) "Destroy Sources". We destroy initial objects.

Additional opportunities:

It is possible to create prefab of any object. For this purpose allocate the necessary objects and pass into "Tools/NGSTools/Super Level Optimizer/Create Prefab". Prefab will remain in the "SLO/Prefabs/" folder.

How to edit the created atlases? For this purpose create prefab according to the instruction above, then pass into the "SLO/Textures/" folder.

I hope You awake are happy with work of my program. E-mail of support: andre-orsk@yandex.ru

Kindest regards,
Andrey.
