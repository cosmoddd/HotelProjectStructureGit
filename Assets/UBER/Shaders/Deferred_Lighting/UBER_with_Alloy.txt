Use "Deferred Shading with UBER.shader" instead of this from Alloy installation to have Alloy with UBER features working.

If you'd like UBER shaders to keep the same light falloff in FORWARD (for example transparent materials) look into UBER_StandardConfig.cginc and set #define UBER_MATCH_ALLOY_LIGHT_FALLOFF 1

Deferred lighting pass shader included here apply to Alloy3.2.3.
If you'd like to update newer Alloy deferred lighting shader look at it's contents. There should be #include for UBER placed already - just uncomment it. Guys from Alloy promised to put it in next release. If not, step by step instruction is like follows:

 1. Find "Alloy Deferred Shading.shader"
 
 2. After all #includes at the beginning add this line:
 
 #include "Assets/UBER/Shaders/Deferred_Lighting/UBER2AlloyDeferred.cginc"
 
 3. Find all "light.shadow =" occurences. After all of them put this line:
 
 UBER2ALLOY_SELFSHADOW_MACRO
 
 4. Find such line "color.rgb = AlloyHdrClamp(AlloyDirect(light, s));"
 
 5. Before the line found (4) add this line:
 
 UBER2ALLOY_TRANSLUCENCY_MACRO_INIT
 
 6. After the line found (4) add this line:
 
 UBER2ALLOY_TRANSLUCENCY_MACRO_APPLY
