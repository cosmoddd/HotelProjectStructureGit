This package contains 10 different types of hospital props.
Just drag the prefabs into your scene and arrange them as you like.

All single parts of the operation-lights can be positionated and rotated as needed.

You may also want to have a look at the example scene that contains all the prefabs.

All textures were created including ambient occlusion.

The original FBX-file is also included in the package.
