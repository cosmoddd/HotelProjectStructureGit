//  dialog between two linewaiters.  It's hard out there..

	Linewaiter 1
How long has it been, now?
	Linewaiter 2
Two hours.
	Linewaiter 1
You think we're actually going to get in at this point?
	Linewaiter 2
Probably not.  I thought I had the look down.
	Linewaiter 1
I have a sinking feeling there's some special dress code tonight.
	Linewaiter 2
Would have been nice if they had told us.
	Linewaiter 1
They never say anything.  It's a gamble every time you come.
	Linewaiter 2
Didn't your sister get in once?
	Linewaiter 1
Three months ago.  She was with a group of people wearing panchos.
	Linewaiter 2
I tried the pancho approach, too, once.  No luck.
	Linewaiter 1
Kate said she had a transcendent night.
	Linewaiter 2
Whatever that means.
	Linewaiter 1
I'm just saying, it's still worth making the journey.
	Linewaiter 2
Yeah, I keep thinking I'm going to quit trying to get in...
But then I hear from people who went that it was this defining experience.
	Linewaiter 1
One day, Tommy. 
We're so close.
	Linewaiter 2
Yeah...
