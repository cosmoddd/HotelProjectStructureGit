	Linewaiter 1
I can't believe what is happening here.
	Linewaiter 2
Indeed I have.  
	Linewaiter 1
You know you didn’t take enough pieces out of the bag when you had the chance.
	Linewaiter 2
Perhaps not.  I was trying something new.
	Linewaiter 1
And that’s why I play you, Bruce.  Always trying something new. 
	Linewaiter 2
Fuck if don’t get a win tonight.
	Linewaiter 1
Nancy’s asleep, and the kitchen staff aren’t breathing down my neck for once.
	Linewaiter 2
Let me try something new.  
	Linewaiter 1
I’ve got you back in your corner, though.
