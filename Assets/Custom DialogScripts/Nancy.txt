	Nancy
We have all these people in for the conference this weekend...
Do we have enough food in the pantry?
Do we have enough hands in the kitchen for room service?
What if we lose hot water again?
What if the air conditioner breaks again?
What if someone falls asleep drunk in the hot tub again?
What if we lose our Blue Moose Sonsorship?
What if there's an incident down at the Holbein Club again?
What if Clem gives up his residency?
What if Professor Smoth can't stop Title 3?
What if the developers get hands on this place?
What if the potential new owners make my job 'redundant?'
What if Bruce starts playing too much Corkscrew again?
???????????
