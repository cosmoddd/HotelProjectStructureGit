BEGIN
	Bruce
You’ve cornered me.  
	Clem
Indeed I have.  
You know you didn’t take enough pieces out of the bag when you had the chance.
	Bruce
Perhaps not.  I was trying something new.
	Clem
And that’s why I play you, Bruce.  Always trying something new. 
	Bruce
Fuck if don’t get a win tonight.  
Nancy’s asleep, and the kitchen staff aren’t breathing down my neck for once.
Let me try something new.  
	Clem
I’ve got you back in your corner, though. 
	Bruce
Baron Up Left.  Round takes three. 
And now you're roll the red dice.  
Come on, Clem, you need to try something new, too, eh?  
BREAK
	Clem
My gaming league in the city is a bad influence on me.  All they do is optimize and play the same angles til they’re raw.  
	Bruce
You’re becoming predictable.
	Clem
Then I should be easy to beat, no?
	Bruce
You’re tempting me to mirror your own strategy and you already know it too well.  
I’d rather lose trying something new and maybe finally crack you open.
	Clem
You always try, but you rarely do. 
	Bruce
The strength of this game, though, is that its possible.
	Clem
You meet anyone at the conference?
	Bruce
Yeah, just some chump developer who wanted a late-night turkey sandwich with mayo.  Didn’t even have his pickle.
	Clem
I read that the vote on Title 3 got delayed again.
	Bruce
Delaying the inevitable.  It’s going to pass.
	Clem
Maybe the right powder in the right sandwich…
	Bruce
Stop it, Clem.  You know I’ve actually thought about doing that to some of these guys.  
	Clem
Yeah.  Me, too, actually.  
	Bruce
You’re not allowed in the kitchen.
	Clem
Is that because I’m a bad cook?
	Bruce
No, it’s because this place is too cheap to afford your cooking habits.  Clem, you know you’re the only person here that pays for a wine locker.
	Clem
They were Norwood’s, there to be used.  Why not by me?
	Bruce
Because I have to go down there every day and maintain the temperature, do readings, ugh.  Are you even going to drink what’s in there
	Clem
Someday.  With the right person.
	Bruce
This right person probably wouldn’t find themselves at the Norwood Hotel during the off-season.
	Clem
Ever try chatting with the gals who go to the Holbein?
	Bruce
They’re from a different planet.  At this point they know who I am here and they keep their distance.
	Clem
Your type doesn’t come around the Norwood Hotel in the off season.  
	Bruce
My type appreciates a few from the Norwood pool while munching a braised zatar chicken sandwich served on toasted wheat bread served with a pickle, prepared by one such as yourself.
	Clem
Title 3 making you worried about losing that view, huh?
	Bruce
I’m worried about losing a lot more than that.
	Clem
You’re not losing anything tonight.  
	Bruce
Say, I notice play better when you think you can work your way out of a corner.  
	Clem
Are you noticing something on the board that I’m not?
	Bruce
Maybe, maybe not.  
	Clem
Oh, Clem…
BREAK
	Clem
Did your parents ever dissuade you from playing games like this? 
	Bruce
I mean, i was raised in a very puritanical hosuehold.
