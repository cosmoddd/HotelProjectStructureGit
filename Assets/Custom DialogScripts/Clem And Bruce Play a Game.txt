	Bruce
You’ve cornered me.  
	Clem
Indeed I have.  
You know you didn’t take enough pieces out of the bag when you had the chance.
	Bruce
Perhaps not.  I was trying something new.
	Clem
And that’s why I play you, Bruce.  Always trying something new. 
	Bruce
I need a win tonight.  
Nancy’s sleeping and the kitchen staff aren’t breathing down my neck for once.
Let me try something new.  
	Clem
I’ve got you back in your corner, though. 
	Bruce
Baron Up Left.  Round takes three. 
And now you're roll the red dice.  
Come on, Clem, you need to try something new, too, eh?  
	Clem
My gaming league in the city is a bad influence on me.  
	Bruce
You’re becoming predictable.
	Clem
Then I should be easy to beat, no?
	Bruce
You’re tempting me to mirror your own strategy and you already know it too well.  
I’d rather lose trying something new and maybe finally crack you open.
	Clem
You always try, but you rarely do. 
	Bruce
The strength of this game, though, is that its possible.
	Clem
Have you had to deal with anyone at the conference?
	Bruce
Some developer ordered a turkey sandwich and complained that the bread wasn't toasted.  
He didn’t even have his pickle.
	Clem
I read that the vote on Title 3 got delayed again.
	Bruce
 It’s going to pass.
	Clem
Put a certain powder in one of those sandwiches next time.
	Bruce
Stop it.  You know I’ve actually thought about doing that to some of these guys.  
	Clem
Yeah.  Me, too, actually.  
	Bruce
Stay out of the kitchen, Clem.
	Clem
My cooking that bad?
	Bruce
This place is too cheap to afford your expertise.
What's this I hear about you having a wine locker?
	Clem
It was Norwood's private wine locker.
Somebody ought to use it, right?
	Bruce
Are you even going to drink what’s in there?
	Clem
Someday.  With the right person.
	Bruce
This right person probably wouldn’t find themselves at the Norwood Hotel, ever.
	Clem
Let me ask you something.
Do you ever chat with the gals who go to the Holbein?
	Bruce
Clem, they’re from a different planet.  
They know who I am and they keep their distance.
	Clem
You don't think one of them would want to have the the honor...
of dating the man behind the Norwood Hotel's storied cuisine?
	Bruce
Have you talked to those people?
	Clem
Sure, they're nice enough.  A bit fixated on getting into the club.
	Bruce
Yeah, I hear it's this big mystery, no one knows how to get in.
You just hope Roy will wave his hands and in you go.  
	Clem
Yeah Roy doesn't really talk about it when he's off the clock.
	Bruce
I'm fine that it's arbitrary.  
	Clem
Like the outcome of this game.  
	Bruce
No, I still have a move to make here.
	Clem
Are you noticing something on the board that I’m not?
	Bruce
Maybe, maybe not.  
	Clem
Oh, Bruce…
