//June and Alan Miranda stand at the edge of the lobby
BEGIN
	Alan
You think you’ll be getting a lot of writing while you’re here?  
	June
I’ll try.  
It’s late so I’m going to be off to a late start tomorrow. 
	Alan
Sometimes if we have a deadline, we tend to wake up early anyway.  
	June
Yeah, Dad.  That’s a problem.  
You lose sleep and that messes with your metabolism.  
	Alan
Well, it never messed with mine, June.  
A little urgency never hurt with the productivity.  
	June
You don't need to tell me, dad.
These writing jobs are client work, not my own stuff.  
	Alan
I thought you were coming here to finish your string quartet?
	June
Me too.  But then the agency called tonight.
They need five versions of "Happy Mouth" by Sunday. 
	Alan
What do they want with that awful song?
	June
It's for Saturn Noodles Birthday-Cake Ramen campaign.
	Alan
Oh, ok.
Well, it's a shame you can't work on your string quartet.
	June
Yep. I'm pretty upset they dumped this on me.
But money is money and I can't really say no.
I hope your conference goes well for you, though. 
	Alan
I've actually been dreading this weekend.  
	June
How can you say that?  Isn’t this, like, your home court, environmental science?
	Alan
The developers know me too well and they’ve been preparing.  
Far more than I can afford to.  
The acquisition of the Norwood Properties is an inevitability to them.
	June
So it’s just you standing in their way, eh?
	Alan
A lot of regulative red-tape is standing in their way.
And usually developers can pay to slice their way through it.
But I think I have a bit of an ace up my sleeve.  
	June
Isn’t that what you always say?
	Alan.
Yeah, but I'm worried this time it could have reprcussions.
	June
Like what?
	Alan
You know I can't tell you.
	June
But you really think you can stop Title 3?  
	Alan
I don't know.  But I do know it's going to get messy in the attempt.
And those developers are prepared to get messy, too.
	June
You want to take a walk outside?
	Alan
I'm gonna need to go over some charts, at least for the next few hours.
	June
Do you want to check out the pool, get your mind off the work for a few minutes?
	Alan
Not yet, June. Let me get through tomorrow, then we can hang out by the pool and relax.
	June
Aren’t you usually in a debrief til after dinner?
	Alan
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.  Well, maybe after that.
	June
24 hours from now… OK.  
	Alan
Don't you have your "Happy Mouth" arrangements to work on, anyway?
	June
Ugh...
