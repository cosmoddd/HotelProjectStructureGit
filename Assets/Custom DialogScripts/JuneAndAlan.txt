//June and Alan Miranda stand at the edge of the lobby
BEGIN
	Alan
Do you think you’ll be getting a lot done on your project while you’re here?  
	June
I mean, I’ll try.  It’s late so I’m going to be off to a late start tomorrow. 
	Alan
I don’t know, sometimes if we have a deadline or something urging us on, we tend to wake up early anyway.  
	June
Yeah, Dad.  That’s a problem.  Then you lose sleep and that messes with your health overall.  
	Alan
It never really messed with mine, June.  Honestly, sometimes that sort of urgency is all you need to achieve something remarkable.  
	June
Well, I hope this is a remarkable weekend for you, Dad.
	Alan
June, I’m afraid this weekend is probably going to be one of the more stressful weekends I’ve had in a long time.  
	June
How can you say that?  Isn’t this, like, your home court, environmental science?
	Alan
The developers know this about me and they’ve been preparing.  Far more than I can afford to.  The acquisition of this property is an inevitability to them.
	June
So it’s just you standing in their way, eh?
	Alan
A romantic notion, June, but no.  A lot of regulative red-tape is standing in their way, and I represent just one thin, easy-to-slice layer of it.  
	June
And you came anyway.  To make your case.
	Alan
Let’s just say I have a bit of an ace up my sleeve.
	June
Ugh, isn’t that what you always say?
	Alan
June, I won’t lie, this meeting is probably going to be a chore.  No one should light a candle for me or the Norwood estate.  But like i said, I think I might have found something that could turn the tables of this whole thing.  
	June
Can you tell me what it is?
	Alan
You know I can’t, honey.  
	June
Hmmph.  I’m getting a drink.  Do you want one?
	Alan
Get me two Blue Mooses.  Extra strong.  I need to get up to the room and go over some charts, at least for the next few hours.
	June
Do you want to just have a quick sit at the bar, get your mind off the work for a few minutes?
	Alan
Not yet, June. Let me get through tomorrow, then we can stroll through the woods and relax.
	June
Aren’t you usually in a debrief til after dinner?
	Alan
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.  Well, maybe after that.
	June
In the moonlight?  24 hours from now… sounds great, Dad.  
	Alan
Remember, two cans of Blue Moose chilled.  Extra strong for your dad. 
	June
Another one.  So three, please.
	Alan
Yes, let’s see how Norwood’s storied staff handles such a brutal order.
