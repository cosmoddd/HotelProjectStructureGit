	Mike
Man, this sucks.  This dump's way out of the way from the festival.  
We’re going to have to call a boat or something.
	Dave
Yeah, i think by the third hour I was ready to punch that lady in the blue suit. 
Blue suits... 
	Mike
They all had blue suits.  
	Dave
Yeah, those suits are a rip-off.
	Jeremy
Honestly, I just want to check out where the Norwood Etudes are kept.
	Mike
Proably behind behind glass, man.
	Dave
In a safe.
	Jeremy
I'll be the promotors knew I wanted to get a look at the Norwood Suite.  
	Mike
Man, you can’t even play it.  No one can.  The promotors chose this place because it was cheap.
	Dave
The promotors would put us up in a barn if it saved money.
	Jeremy
Well Martha’s farm was cool and you can’t forget her cooking.
	Mike
Her cooking was okay.  Still wish i could gotten some lamb chops.
	Jeremy
Martha can’t kill her sheep.  Her sweater business bankrolls that whole operation. 
	Mike
I’d spill lambchop grease all over her sweaters.
	Jeremy
Then you'd have to buy one.
	Mike
Forget it.  To much money.
	Dave
So Jeremy, you going to try to checkout the Norwood Suite?
	Jeremy
Tempting but I need my hands in good working order for this tour.  Remember how my arms gave out after our residency at Cubeland?  
	Mike
Cubeland, man.  Those promotors were even worse than these.    
	Dave
You know, there was an article in the Coil about Norwood a few months back.  I think Vuvos is re-issuing his discography in some kind of deluxe vinyl set.  
	Mike
Knowing Vuvos, it’ll be insanely overpriced.   
	Jeremy
At least it’s helping people remember Norwood, the man.  This hotel has sort of eclipsed the man.  
	Dave
He lived here, right?
	Jeremy
He didn’t just live here, this place was like a universe that orbited around him.  
He learned here.  
He perfected his craft here.  
Piano Works VII and VIII were written for him, here while Xenokos stayed here.  
He loved here.  
	Dave
Did he die here?
	Jeremy
The Coil article says he died under ‘dubious circumstances’ and unusually they don’t really get too much into that.  
I assume it was here, though.  What people don’t know is that Norwood the home and norwood the Hotel are basically one and the same.  
Very little has changed since it got repurposed.   
	Mike
Yeah, they never renovated and it looks it.   
	Dave
I mean, people tell me the baths are still the place to go.  
	Jeremy
Yeah I think you should just hang out down here most of the day tomorrow.  
	Mike
I’ll be in the woods.  But i guess for now… we need to check in?
	Everyone
