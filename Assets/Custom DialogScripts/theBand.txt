	Jeremy
Where do you think they keep the Norwood Etudes?
	Mike
Proably behind glass, man.
	Dave
The promotors knew you wanted to get a look at the Norwood Etudes, Jer.  
	Mike
Man, you can't play that shit.  No one can.  
The promotors chose this place because it was cheap.
	Dave
The promotors would put us up in a barn if it saved money.
	Jeremy
Remember Jane's barn?  That was pretty nice, actually.  
	Dave
I was forced into the shower after that tour.
	Jeremy
I need my hands in good working order for this tour.  
I'm not making the same mistake I made at at Cubeland. 
	Mike
Let's leave Cubeland in the rearview.    
	Dave
You know, there was an article in the Coil about Norwood a few months back.  
Vuvos is re-issuing his discography.  Some kind of deluxe vinyl set.  
	Mike
That's all the Vuvos label does now.  Rip-off vinyl deluxe sets.
	Jeremy
It’s helping people remember Norwood, the man, though.  
This hotel has sort of eclipsed him.  
	Dave
He lived here, right?
	Jeremy
He didn’t just live here.
This place was the center of his musical universe.    
Piano Works VII and VIII were written for him here.
Xenokos was living here for a few summers.  Nobody knows that.  
We should see if they'll let us rehearse in his auditorium.
	Dave
What happened to him, anyway?
	Jeremy
Vanished. No note, no clues, nothing.
Various owners of the estate have attempted to maintain the decor.
In his honor.  
	Mike
Yeah, they never renovated and it looks like it.   
	Dave
People tell me the baths are still the place to go.  
	Jeremy
Yeah I think you should just hang out down here tomorrow.
Before rehearsal, of course.
	Dave
Of course, dude.  I never miss rehearsal.
	Mike
I’ll be in woods the making field recordings til then.
	Everyone
