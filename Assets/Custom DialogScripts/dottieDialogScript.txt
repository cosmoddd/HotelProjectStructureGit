	//Sandro
Hey, Dottie, looks like we have a late-night arrival.
Dottie!
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
Sandro!
You don't have to shout at me!
	//Sandro
Your hearing aids aren't in.
	//Dottie
I left them in my room. Sue me.  
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Sandro looks at You
A late arrival.   This is unexpected.
	//Sandro
Most of the conference attendees arrived earlier today.
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
Maybe our friend here isn't from the conference.
	//Sandro
This is a special weekend.
Very few outsiders.
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Dottie
I pegged you for a Holbein Club attendee...
But a private event is going on down there.
	//Sandro
Yeah, it's some sort of masks-only thing.
	//Dottie
Well, as you have a reservation, it's not my business what brings you here.
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
Some people might still consider the Norwood Hotel a destination.
	//Dottie
This place?  Ha.
		// Loop 1 Begin
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Dottie
Can I see a reservation confirmation number?
	// Reservation False
Hmmm...
Unfortunately I can’t give you a room key without a reservation confirmation.
Our system is antiquated like that.
	//Sandro
Protocol is strict due to the ongoing conference.
We've required that all guests provide a specific code that confirms their stay here.
	//Dottie
You would have gotten it in an email.  
If you need to access your email, we've provided a computer terminal behind you.
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
When was the last time you checked your email, Dottie?
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
Do you even use email?
	//Dottie
...
	// Broken Terminal Check
	// Broken Terminal True
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Dottie
The terminal is non-functional, eh?
Well, Sandro can help you with that.
	//Sandro
I can?
What is there to help with?
	//Sandro looks at You
You seem perfectly capable of figuring out what to do.  
	// WiFi Check
	// Wifi Off True
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Dottie
Trouble with the wireless internet?
Our wireless router is a little finicky. 
You might have to reset it.
I need to tell Nadia we need a new router.
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
Good luck with that. 
	// Wifi Working
I think you got the wireless internet functional.
Sandro, I wish you would handle this stuff.
	//Sandro
They don't pay me enough to turn on the appliances.
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Dottie
Sandro's been rejected from the Holbein Club one too many times.
I think it's starting to affect his morale.
	//Sandro looks at You
	//Sandro
I just need to convince Manfred I'm not going to make a scene down there.
		//Loop 1 End
	// Reservation Confirmed
Ah, yes.  I have your room assignment and...
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
What's wrong?
	//Dottie
Oh boy, there must be a mistake.  
Hmmm..  
21 is Andre’s room.  
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
Hasn't Andre been there for, what, 20 years?
	//Sandro looks at You
	//Dottie
This is a total clerical error.  His room is definitely NOT available.
All of our other rooms seem to be full up for the big conference this weekend.  
I feel so terrible, but I've got nothing.  
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
What about 34?
	//Dottie
34?  
	//Sandro
Yeah, the Norwood Suite.  
	//Dottie
Are you kidding?  Absolutely no way.
	//Sandro
But it’s still vacant, right?
	//Dottie
Of course it’s vacant.  
It’s the Norwood Suite.  
No one is permitted to stay there.
	//Sandro
Says Nadia.  
	//Dottie
And last I heard, Nadia still cuts our checks.  
	//Sandro
That she does.
	//Dottie
And she has said under no uncertain terms that the Norwood Suite is off-limits.  
Really, I’m sorry, but there is very little I can do here besides offer you a refund.
And this case of Blue Moose.
	//Sandro
Really, Dottie?
Do you want to risk another bad write-up in Traveller’s Quarterly.  
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
No, and let’s not discuss that in front of our customers.
	//Sandro
Technically, our friend here is no longer a customer - you’re turning him away! 
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Dottie
You know what?  Here...
Take the key.
But by 8am, you need to be out of there.  
The Norwood Suite was Peter Norwood’s bedroom when this was still his estate.
A lot of his old stuff is still in there.  
Anything out of place and you’ll be on the hook for a fortune you can't begin to fathom.  
Consider this an incredibly rare privilege.
	//Sandro looks at You
	//Sandro
I don’t think half our staff have even seen inside the Norwood Suite,
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
And Sandro, you’re responsible for making that room look like no one has been in there in twenty years.
Because that is indeed the case.  Right, Sandro? 
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
I’m a professional, Dottie.  
	//Dottie
You keep telling yourself that.  
Report to me in the morning.
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Sandro looks at You
As for you… anything out of place and it goes on your card, got it?  
Good.  Goodnight!
// End of intro dialog.
// Loop 2
Never thought I'd be telling anyone to go to Room 34.
Some people don't realize how good they have it.
Ha.
