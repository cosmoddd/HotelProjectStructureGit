Sandro! Would you please stop doing that?!
Guests don’t leave books like this in the library.
Oh, Oh wait, you’re not Sandro.  Please excuse me.  
These glasses are for reading, not face recognition.  
A late arrival.   No matter.
		// Loop 1 Begin
Can I see a reservation confirmation number?  	
	// Reservation False
Hmmm...
Ok, well, unfortunately I can’t give you a room key without a reservation confirmation.
Our system is antiquated up here
And security is tight due to the ongoing conference.  
I'll need a reservation confirmation number from you before I can give you a room.  
You would have gotten it in an email.  If you need to access your email, there’s  terminal behind you.
	// Broken Terminal Check
	// Broken Terminal True
The terminal is broken, eh?   Well, Sandro can help you with that.
	// WiFi Check
	// Wifi Off True
Trouble with the wireless internet?  
The router is upstairs, in the library above us.
You want to use it?  Go ahead and plug it in.
	// Wifi Working
I think you got the wireless internet functional.
I wish Sandro would tend to these things.
But they don't pay him enough.
Or maybe he's got his mind on other things.
Like let in to High End Ruminations. 
Ha! They'll never accept him.
		//Loop 1 End
	// Reservation Confirmed
Ah, yes.  I have your room assignment and...
Oh boy, there must be a mistake.  
Hmmm..  
211 is Andre’s room.  Andre has been staying here twenty years.  
Who in there right mind would think to make it available?  Oh dearie.  
All of our other rooms seem to be full up for the big conference this weekend.  
I feel so terrible, I don’t know what to do… wait.  
		// Sandro enters the picture.
What about 316?
	//Dottie
316?  
	//Sandro
Yeah, the Norwood Suite.  
	//Dottie
Are you joking?  The Norwood Suite is not available.  Absolutely no way.
	//Sandro
But it’s still vacant, right?
	//Dottie
Of course it’s vacant.  
It’s the Norwood Suite.  
No one is permitted to stay there.
	//Sandro
Says Nadia.  
	//Dottie
And last I heard, Nadia still cuts our checks.  
	//Sandro
That she does.
	//Dottie
And she has said under no uncertain terms that the Norwood Suite is off-limits.  
Really, I’m sorry, but there is very little I can do here besides offer you a refund and a case of Blue Moose.  
	//Sandro
Dottie, it’s late.  And Blue Moose?  
Do you want to risk another bad write-up in Traveller’s Quarterly.  
You were singled out last time.  
	//Dottie
No, and let’s not discuss that in front of our customers.
	//Sandro
Technically, our friend here is no longer a customer - you’re turning him away! 
	//Dottie
You know what?  Here...
Take the key.
But by 8am, you need to be out of there.  
The Norwood Suite was Peter Norwood’s bedroom when this was still his estate.
A lot of his old stuff is still in there.  
Anything out of place and you’ll be on the hook for a while.  
Consider this an incredibly rare privilege.   
I don’t think half our staff have even seen inside the Norwood Suite,
But oh boy am I in the rarest of generous moods today.  
And Sandro, you’re responsible for making that room look like no one has been in there in twenty years.
Because that is indeed the case.  Right, Sandro? 
	//Sandro
I’m a professional, Dottie.  
	//Dottie
You keep telling yourself that.  
Report to me in the morning.  
As for you… anything out of place and it goes on your card, got it?  
Good.  Goodnight!
// End of intro dialog.
// Loop 2
Norwood was a cool guy, so they say.
Some peopel don't realize how good they have it.
Ha.
