Sandro, Stop doing that. 
Guests don’t leave books like this in the library.
Oh, Oh wait, you’re not Sandro.  Please excuse me.  
These glasses are for reading, not face recognition.  
Ah, a late arrival.   No matter.  
Can I see a reservation confirmation number?  	
		// DOES NOT HAVE RESERVATION NUMBER
Ok, well, unfortunately I can’t give you a room key without a reservation confirmation.  
Our system is a little antiquated up here, you see - all key info in this little red book.  
I'll need a reservation confirmation number from you before I can give you a room.  
You would have gotten it in an email.  If you need to access your email, there’s  terminal behind you.
		// broken terminal?
The terminal is broken, eh?   Well, Sandro can help you with that.  
		// loop back to 5    confirm ---v
Ah, yes.  I have your room assignment and...
Oh boy, there must be a mistake.  
Hmmm..  
211 is Andre’s room.  Andre has been staying here twenty years.  
Who in there right mind would think to make it available?  Oh dearie.  
All of our other rooms seem to be full up for the big conference this weekend.  
I feel so terrible, I don’t know what to do… wait.  
		// Sandro enters the picture.
What about 316?
	//Dottie
316?  
	//Sandro
Yeah, the Norwood Suite.  
	//Dottie
Are you joking?  The Norwood Suite is not available.  Absolutely no way.
	//Sandro
But it’s still vacant, right?
	//Dottie	
Of course it’s vacant.  
It’s the Norwood Suite.  
No one is permitted to stay there.
	//Sandro
Says Nadia.  
	//Dottie
And last I heard, Nadia still cuts our checks.  
	//Sandro
That she does.
	//Dottie
And she has said under no uncertain terms that the Norwood Suite is off-limits.  
Really, I’m sorry, but there is very little I can do here besides offer you a refund and a case of Blue Moose.  
	//Sandro
Dottie, it’s late.  And Blue Moose?  
Do you want to risk another bad write-up in Traveller’s Quarterly.  
You were singled out last time.  
	//Dottie
No, and let’s not discuss that in front of our customers.
	//Sandro
Technically, our friend here is no longer a customer - you’re turning him away! 
	//Dottie
You know what?  Here.  Take the key.  
But by 8am, you need to be out of there.  
The Norwood Suite was Peter Norwood’s bedroom when this was still his estate.
A lot of his old stuff is still in there.  
Anything out of place and you’ll be on the hook for a while.  
In fact I’m going to need a card for registration and payment when you check out.  
Can I have that?  
	//Credit Card check false
Hmmm.. this debit card doesn’t seem to want to go through.  Try something else...
	//Loop back to 56 --- Credit Card Check true  ===v
Very fine.  Now, here’s the key.  
Consider this an incredibly rare privilege.   
I don’t think half our staff have even seen inside the Norwood Suite,
But oh boy am I in the rarest of generous moods today.  
And Sandro, you’re responsible for making that room look like no one has been in there in twenty years.
Because that is indeed the case.  Right, Sandro? 
	//Sandro
I’m a professional, Dottie.  
	//Dottie
You keep telling yourself that.  
Report to me in the morning.  
As for you… anything out of place and it goes on your card, got it?  
Good.  Goodnight!
